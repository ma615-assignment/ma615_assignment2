#' The author should wrangle data and then use the data to produce plots instead of only extracting data needed by the plot. 
#' For example, the data should include all the countries in the origin table and set parameters in the function. But the author only chooses China and Canada in a data frame.
#' In a function, the condition or data selection can complete by setting parameters so it will be convenient to different plot values.
